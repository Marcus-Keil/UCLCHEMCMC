# Photoreactions & H2 Formation
Updated H2 Formation to Cazaux & Tielens 2004 formulism ahead of major grain update
C photoionization, H2 self-shielding and CO self-shielding treatments brought over from UCLPDR

#Reaction Temperature Bounds
Reactions can now be duplicated (same reactants and products) with different rates and temperature bounds. UCLCHEM will then use the correct rate for the current temperature.
