        This is the Home page to the MCMC Inference code {{ name }} (Prototype name).
        This serves as a test for the creation of a web based GUI for the code in order
        to allow for observers to have easy access to the code and its capabilities.

        To run an inference, use "Inference" option on the sidebar.
